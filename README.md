# Project-Euler
This repository is full of solutions of Project Euler exercises in python and other languages.

I am creating what I hope to be a repository of solutions to exercises for people to learn their first programming language or to add another language to their toolbelt.

I have a vision of this project becoming something like Wikipedia, Mozilla, or Apache: creating completely free educational content (free as in speech and lunch) for anyone and everyone to use as a learning tool.

This is just a side project, for now, but as it grows this readme will become more complex as will the educational items produced. I hope to, eventually, produce supplemental educational material to be used in conjunction with the solutions here to learn a language.

I am seeking funding to take this project from a labor of love to a true foundation; to create something where I can take on more people and commit more time to the project and its goals.
